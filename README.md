# Welcome to Adrian Nelson's and Aidan Chin's colloborative ECE 371 Intro to Security Repository
This is meant as way to remotely access and share code as we complete each project. These projects are being done with the DE1SOC Altera FPGA Board. 

This code is written in a different of languuges such as: Python, C, .... (To be added to as semester continues)

# Lab1: Buffer Overflow Demonstration
Using two adjecent memory spaces of 9 memory addresses for student ID numbers, show how buffer overflow can show you data that was not intended to 
be shared. ex: Getting rid of a NULL terminator '\0' in C using a scanf() command without the "%9s" limiter.

# Lab2: RSA and DES Demonstration
Implementing RSA to encrypt a DES key and using that encrypted key to encrypt and decrypt an image via DES (The Linux Penguin, penguin.jpg)
